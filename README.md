# ImageToText
A python script that "translates" a given image into text using PIL and [Braille Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_Patterns).

Note: This looks inverted if yout texteditor has a white background and black text.
Change the 255 in line 27 to 0 if you want to use this with a white background and black text.
